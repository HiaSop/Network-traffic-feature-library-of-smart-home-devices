Internet activities are represented by alternating communication between clients (iot devices) and servers in a request-response manner. Each type of event is uniquely identified by a pair (or longer sequence) of exchanged packets of a specific length. With the help of PingPong tool, the packet size and direction characteristics of smart home traffic can be extracted to establish corresponding on/off event fingerprints for five devices: Xiaomi intelligent camera, Xiaomi smart socket, Mijia LED bulb, Aqara LED bulb, and Aqara door and window sensor.
